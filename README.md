# Java CRUD Rest API using Spring Boot, Hibernate, Postgres, Docker and Docker Compose

<h1>Introduction</h1>
I follow the next steps:
1. Create a Java application using Spring Boot, Spring Web, Spring Data and Hibernate.
2. Run the Postgres database in a container using Docker Compose, and test connection with TablePlus.
3. Dockerize the Java application writing a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file to run the application and the database.
4. Build the Java app, build the Docker image and run the container using Docker Compose, then test it with Postman.
